## Description

This challenge was super helpful in many ways. It really taught me the basic way an e-commerce website runs. The way to relate multiple tables through each other and run it all through an express server is very relatable to many applications. I learned how to best use Insomnia for testing and it really makes things go faster.

## Installation

You start by seeding the data into mysql by first typing "npm run seed" into the terminal. Then you start the server in the terminal by typing "npm start". Then use Insomnia to make calls to the api using the express server.

## Usage

You could use this framework for many different types of online e-commerce applications. It can be very dynamic and easy to expand.
